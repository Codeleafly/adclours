### Library Overview: `adcolors.mjs` â€“ Powerful Cross-Runtime Terminal Styling

`adcolors.mjs` is a highly potent and comprehensive JavaScript library designed for advanced terminal text styling and formatting. The core of this library, `adcolors.mjs`, is built exclusively using native Node.js and Deno built-in modules, ensuring seamless cross-runtime compatibility across Node.js, Deno, and TypeScript environments without any code modifications. It provides a fluent, chainable API with over 50 features, enabling developers to create visually rich and professional command-line interfaces (CLIs).

### Core Capabilities and Features:

*   **Comprehensive Coloring**: Offers extensive coloring options including basic ANSI colors, bright/hi-intensity colors, full 256-color palette support, and 24-bit true color (RGB and HEX). It also includes over 50 extended named colors for convenience.
*   **Fluent Chainable API**: Features an intuitive and chainable syntax via the `color` object, simplifying complex styling combinations (e.g., `color.red.bold.underline('Hello World')`).
*   **Advanced Text Effects**:
    *   **Gradients and Rainbow**: Apply beautiful color gradients and rainbow effects to text.
    *   **Blending**: Blend two colors based on a specified ratio and various blending modes ('normal', 'multiply', 'screen').
    *   **Shade Generation**: Dynamically generate an array of lighter or darker shades from a base color.
*   **Terminal UI Components**:
    *   **Progress Bars**: Create dynamic and color-coded progress bars to visualize long-running operations.
    *   **Box Drawing**: Construct customizable boxes around text with single, double, or triple-line borders and specified colors.
    *   **ASCII Art**: Convert regular text into styled ASCII art.
    *   **Tables and Lists**: Easily format data into structured tables with alignment options and styled lists with custom symbols.
    *   **Horizontal Lines and Titles**: Generate horizontal lines and centered title/subtitle blocks to structure terminal output.
*   **Text Manipulation Utilities**:
    *   **Strip ANSI Codes**: Remove all ANSI escape codes from a string, useful for calculating actual text length or for logging.
    *   **Centering and Wrapping**: Center text within a given width or wrap long text to fit terminal dimensions.
    *   **Padding**: Pad text to the left or right with specified characters to achieve uniform alignment.
*   **Interactive Elements**:
    *   **Spinners**: Implement animated spinners for background processes, providing visual feedback to users.
    *   **Animations**: Create text animations like blinking or pulsing effects for emphasis, with start/stop control.
*   **Structured Logging System**: A dedicated `log` object provides timestamped and styled methods for informational (`info`), success (`success`), warning (`warn`), error (`error`), and debug messages, enhancing the clarity of CLI output.
*   **Cross-Runtime Abstraction**: Built with an abstraction layer for `stdout` writing and process exit listeners, ensuring consistent behavior and cleanup routines across Deno and Node.js environments.
*   **Color Utilities**: Includes functions like `toRgb` for robust color parsing (named, hex, RGB) and `findNearestColor` to identify the closest named color to any given RGB or HEX input.
